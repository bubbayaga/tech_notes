'programming with asynrhonous data streams' 

Anything can be made a stream, including but not limited to caches, data structures, variables, user inputs, and more.

Streams can emit a value, error, and a completed signal.

These emitted events are captured asynchronously and functions are defined that execute when a value, error or completed signal is emitted.
